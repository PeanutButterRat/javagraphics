# javagraphics

This repository holds my project submissions for CSC 155 (Advanced Computer Graphics) at California State University, Sacramento with Dr. Scott Gordon. CSC 155 tasks students with making several scenes with Java and OpenGL.


## Usage
To get going with this project, following the installations steps in ``setup.pdf`` to download JOGL and JOML. In each assignment subfolder, there are scripts to build and run each submission named ``compile.bat`` and ``run.bat`` respectively.


## License

While you are free to use any code in here that I wrote for any purpose under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), please be wary that some helper code was written by Dr. Gordon and not me (mainly ``Utils.java``) which I believe comes from his textbook (Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with Java by V. Scott Gordon PhD). There are also some free models and assets used in some of the scenes which have their own licenses as well. See ``license.txt`` in each assignment subfolder for more information.
